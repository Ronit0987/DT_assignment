I developed a web scraping and text analysis pipeline to categorize websites into categories like F&B, Manufacturer, Brand, Distributor, Not Related, and Formulation. I scrape content from "About Us" and "Products" pages, preprocess the text, and match it against predefined keywords. I also analyze the context using spaCy, assign a category based on keyword presence and context, and store the results in a structured CSV file for further analysis.
